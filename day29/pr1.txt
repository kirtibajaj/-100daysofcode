Problems
Given a N x N binary matrix A where each row and column of the matrix is sorted in ascending order , Your task is to complete the function  countZero which returns the count of  number of 0s present in it.

Note : Elements in matrix can be either 1 or 0

Input:
The first line of input will be the no of test cases then T test cases will follow . The second line of each test case contains two space separated integers M,N denoting the size of the 2 d matrix . Then in the next lines are the space separated values of the matrix A[ ] [ ] . 

Output:
The output will be the number of zeroes present in the square matrix.

Constraints:
1<=T<=50
1<=M,N<=50
0<=A[][]<=1
Example:
Input
1
3
0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1
Output
6

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
