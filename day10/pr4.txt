TDS always plans trips which cover exactly three places. In his last trip he spent all his money on the first two destinations and had to return home without visiting the final one due to his strict budget of R.

TDS asked you to help him in planning his trip expenses. He spends x amount in destination one , y  amount in destination two, and z amount in destination three. Unfortunately, in destination two he always loses twice the amount he spends in destination two and in destination three he always loses thrice the amount he spends in destination three .i.e. x+(2y+y)+(z+3z)=R (where x,y,z>=1). You have to output the number of valid triplets of the amounts he could spend in the three destinations .i.e.(x,y,z).
