You are given an array of integers , you need to find the maximum sum that can be obtained by picking some non-empty subset of the array. If there are many such non-empty subsets, choose the one with the maximum number of elements. Print the maximum sum and the number of elements in the chosen subset.

Input:

The first line contains an integer , denoting the number of elements of the array. Next line contains  space-separated integers, denoting the elements of the array.

Output:

Print  space-separated integers, the maximum sum that can be obtained by choosing some subset and the maximum number of elements among all such subsets which have the same maximum sum.
