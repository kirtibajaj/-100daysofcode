In this challenge, you will determine whether a string is funny or not. To determine whether a string is funny, create a copy of the string in reverse e.g. . Iterating through each string, compare the absolute difference in the ascii values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2 and so on to the end. If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny.

Determine whether a give string is funny. If it is, return Funny, otherwise return Not Funny.

For example, given the string , the ordinal values of the charcters are . and the ordinals are . The absolute differences of the adjacent elements for both strings are , so the answer is Funny.

Function Description

Complete the funnyString function in the editor below. For each test case, it should return a string, either Funny or Not Funny.

funnyString has the following parameter(s):

s: a string to test
Input Format

Sample Input

2
acxz
bcxz
Sample Output

Funny
Not Funny
Explanation

You can use  to store the reverse of .

Test Case 0:

,  
Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings: 
 and  
For both the strings the adjacent difference list is [2, 21, 2] so we print Funny.

Test Case 1:

,  
Corresponding ASCII values of characters of the strings: 
 and  
The adjacent difference list for string  is [1, 21, 2] and for string  it is [2, 21, 1]. Since they are not the same we print Not Funny.
