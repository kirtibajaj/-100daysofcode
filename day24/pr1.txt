You are given an array of \(N\)  numbers. Count the number of subarrays having the absolute value of sum strictly greater than \(K\)   i.e \(|sum| > K\) .

 

Input Format

The first line contains a positive integer \(T\) , the number of test cases. 
Each test case contains a single integer \(N\)  which denotes the number of elements in the array.
The next line contains  \(N\)  space separated integers \(A_1, A_2, A_3, .... ,A_N\) denoting the elements in the array.
Output Format 

For each test case print the answer in a new line.

Constraints

\(1 <= T <= 10^3\)
\(1 <= N <=2*10^5\)
\(1<= K <= 10^{18}\)
\(|A_i| <=10^9\)
The sum of \(N\) over all test cases does not exceed \(2*10^5\)
 

SAMPLE INPUT 
2
3 2
2 -2 3
5 0
2 -3 0 3 2
SAMPLE OUTPUT 
2
13
Explanation
1. In the first Test Case, the subarrays with sum greater than 2 are

{3}  Sum=3

{2,-2,3} Sum= 2 -2 + 3 = 3

2. In the 2nd test Case, there are total 15 subarrays.

All except {0}  {-3,0,3} have sum greater than 0.
