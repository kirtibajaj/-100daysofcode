Joey is always in fond of playing with patterns. So on his birthday his uncle gave him a mat.  Mat is a rectangular grid. i.e. there are  rows and  columns drawn on the mat.  Each cell of this grid is filled with either dot or star. Now Joey starts to fold this mat.  Firstly he folds the mat along the rows (top to down) until it transforms into a  grid (Neglect width of mat on each fold). After that he starts folding this along the columns (left to right) and finally transforms into a single cell. At the end Joey wants to know what will be on the top of that cell dot or star.

See the below image for more explanation.

Each of next  lines contains a string of length .
